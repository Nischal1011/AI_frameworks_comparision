# 🌟 LangGraph vs LangChain Demo

A demonstration project comparing LangGraph and LangChain approaches for building conversational AI systems with context awareness and state management.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains two implementations of a conversational AI system:
- A LangGraph-based implementation with stateful, graph-based processing
- A LangChain-based implementation using traditional linear processing

Both systems interact with a document about computer history to showcase their capabilities and differences.

## ✨ Key Features

### LangGraph Implementation
- 📝 Stateful conversation management
- 🔄 Context retention across queries
- 🌐 Graph-based workflow
- 🧠 Enhanced reasoning capabilities

### LangChain Implementation
- 🔍 Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- 📚 Document-based retrieval
- 🔄 Linear processing workflow

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```

## 📊 Sample Queries

The demo includes example queries about computer history:
- "Who invented the Analytical Engine?"
- "Did it influence modern computers?"
- "What came after the Analytical Engine?"
- "What improvements did the transistor bring?"

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature | LangGraph | LangChain |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Context Retention | ✅ Maintains context across queries | ❌ Limited context awareness |
| Processing Model | 🌐 Graph-based | ➡️ Linear |
| State Management | ✅ Stateful | ❌ Stateless |
| Response Detail | 🎯 Comprehensive, connected | 📝 Direct, isolated |
